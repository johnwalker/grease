#+PROPERTY: depends bundles namespaces tasks
#+PROPERTY: provides junctions

* Junction
  A junction is a task that allows the programmer to operate on the
  elements inside of a bundle by name, rather than by position.  All
  names in the bundle's implicit namespace are made available directly
  in the junction.

** Syntax
   A junction is a list of task streams inside of curly braces '{}'.
