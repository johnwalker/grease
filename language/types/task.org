* Task Type
  The task type is kindof a hybrid between a type and a typeclass.
  Since tasks can have typeclasses as arguments and return types, a
  task type may not be definite.
  
  A task type specifies the argument type, the return type, and the
  fact that it is, in fact, a task.
  
** Syntax
   Syntactically, a task type is the argument type followed by the
   keyword 'task' followed by the return type.
   
   If I had a task that took a vector of integral types, and returned
   an integral type for example, the type would be represented as
   follows.
   
#+BEGIN_SRC Grease
[] integral task integral
#+END_SRC
   
   If you choose to rely on structural equivelance, and you want more
   separation between the different elements of the type, the
   following is also acceptable.
   
#+BEGIN_SRC Grease
([] integral) task (integral)
#+END_SRC
