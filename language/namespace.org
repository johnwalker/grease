* Namespace
  A namespace is a conveniant way of organizing variables.  There are
  a couple of different places that namespaces appear.
  
** Directory Structure
   The language is filesystem aware.  This is to say, putting code in
   a sub-directory creates a namespace the same name as the
   dub-directory by default, and the variables creaeted in the code in
   that directory reside in that namespace.  The name of the namespace
   can be overridden by putting a file called '.namespace' inside the
   directory, with the forst and only line being the desird name.

** Named Bundles
   The arrow and dot operators get at the value in a bundle, but the
   double-colon operator yeilds the name of the member.  This is so
   that you can assign directly to a member of a bundle.

*** TODO
    How does the double-colon interact with references to bundles?  Do
    we need a generic syntax for expressing sub-expressions?
