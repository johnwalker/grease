* Vectorization
  Vectorization is a language feature that allows tasks to be executed
  across vectors.  It is triggered when one or more arguments to a
  task are in a vector form of the type that the task is looking
  for.
  
  If different arguments are vectors of differing dimensions, then the
  first dimension of the vectors are expanded until the types match
  the required types of the task.  The sizes of the first dimensions
  of all expandable vectors must match.
  
  If not all arguments are in vector form, then they will be
  duplicated for each execution of the task.
