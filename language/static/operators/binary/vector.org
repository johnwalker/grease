* Vector Operators
  These are a special class of binary operator that take a vector as
  the first argument, and an integral type as the second.  The return
  type is always a vector of the same size as the original.
  
  | Name                | Symbol | Short Description                                                      |
  | Vector Left Shift   | [<<]   | Shifts all of the elements in the vector left by the second argument   |
  | Vector Right Shift  | [>>]   | Shifts all of the elements in the vector right by the second argument  |
  | Vector Left Rotate  | [<<%]  | Rotates all of the elements in the vector left by the second argument  |
  | Vector Right Rotate | [>>%]  | Rotates all of the elements in the vectos right by the second argument |

** Notes
 
*** Vector Shifts
    The empty spaces are replaced with the value '0' in both shifts.
    No, vectors are not signed.
