* Order Directive
  The order directive allows you to modify the vectorization behavior
  of a task.  If you want to perform an ordered operation over all of
  the elements of a vector, then the easiest way is to use an order
  directive.

** Syntax
   The directive itself is the keyword 'order' followed by a bundle
   containing names.  The first name is the name of the vector to
   iterate over in order, and the following elements are any shared
   resources that you would like the construct to have atomic access
   to.

*** Example
    The followint example shows how to print out all of the elements
    if an array in order, and uninterrupted.  Note that without the
    'stdout' srgument, another print statement could print to stdout
    in the middle of this operation.
    
#+BEGIN_SRC Grease
(0..10) :a;
(stdout, a) order (a, stdout) printint;
#+END_SRC
