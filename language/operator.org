* Operators
  Operators are the fundamental building blocks of any program.  They
  are tasks with special names that are built in to the compiler.
  They also happen to be the only thing that survives when the
  compiler finishes converting into the internal representation for
  optimization.

** Operator Precendence
   Evaluation of all of the things is strict left-to-right.
