* Prefix Operators
  Prefix operators operate on the current state of the stream, and
  take a name as an argument.
  
  | Name  | Symbol | Short Description                                                                                                  |
  |-------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Colon | :      | Assigns the name that follows to the variable, allowing that variable to be referred to elsewhere within the scope |
  | Dot   | .      | Replaces the current variable with the value in the track attached to the name that follows                        |
  | Arrow | ->     | Basically a macro for '* .'                                                                                        |

** Notes

*** Colon
    The colon does not require anything to be in the variable in order
    to be used, which would be useful for declaring a variable name
    before you use it.
