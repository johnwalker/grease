* Structural Equivalence
  When dealing with bundles, the language can do some implicit
  conversion between different layouts.  If two bundles were to have
  their types laid out as in a depth-first search, and have the
  results be identical, then the two bundles are equivalent.  Put
  another way, if the flattened types of two bundles are the same,
  then the types of the bundles are equivalent.  This does not imply
  anything about the actual scope heirarchy of a bundle tree, however.
  In order to rearrange the heirarchy such that you can do positional
  operations as if it were of a different structure, you need to do an
  explicit typecast.
