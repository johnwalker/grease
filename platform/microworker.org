* Micro Worker
  The unit that actually gets all of thw work done is a tiny little
  loop on each core that pulls things off of the active queue.  It can
  only deal with things coming off of the active queue, however, so it
  is up to the compiler to insert the code for doing anything else
  into the tasks being executed.
  
  Since things on the active queue can require network communications
  when they are executed and whatnot, the little worker will be
  capable of looking through the meta information and sending network
  requests as appropriate.
