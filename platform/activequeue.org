* The Active Queue
  The active queue is the queue from which tasks are directly
  executed.  It's really a priority structure of queues, and each
  queue is not strictly a queue, as a distributed system will
  inevetably execute things out of order.

** Pulling From The Active Queue
   For the most part, this is a fairly straightforward process - pull
   next thing off of the queue and execute - but if the next thing
   happens to be a distributed task, then the micro worker has to do a
   little extra work.

** Notifying Sync'd Machines
   Any machine that is capable of executing this task needs to know if
   this task actually is getting executed.  Two things come of this.
   One, if more than one machine tries to execute a task, some kind of
   resolution needs to occur.  Two, for any of the task's possible
   children there needs to be some machine that can execute that
   child.
