* Grease Compiler Frontend Overview

** Organization
   
   
   The idea is that a module traverses the filesystem under the source
   directory first, spawning tokenizer/parser objects for each file
   found, pointing to the appropriate namespace.  These all filter
   into a tree representation of the code, which is then analysed into
   the CFG representation for the next stage.
   
   At some point the namespaces are name-mangled into the relevant
   symbols, rather than imposing structure on the code.
